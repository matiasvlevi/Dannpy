What it does:
------------
Dannpy allows you to create Deep Neural Networks. 

How it works:
------------
1. Create the Dann Object (neural network), specify the number of input neurons and the number of output neurons.
2. Add the hidden layers. To add a hidden layer, you have to specify the neuron count and the activation function.
3. Change some other settings (learning rate, loss function) & .log(); the model to display information.
4. Feed/train the model with some data!
